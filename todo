Cleaning media woes..

Fails to handle loading CLNxxxL1 into LTO4 drive correctly..

  ================================
Error writing to media of 0bytes capacity..

I'm not 100% sure this is a real bug. The end-of-media is a Early warning which
most software treats as end-of-media. The writes still complete successfully.
Even tar handles this OK.
