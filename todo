 - Add ability to set media as 'write protected'
 - Review return values from functions and make consistent.
   Some functions return SAM_STAT_XXX, some return *sam_status
 - REPORT DENSITY is broken. Needs to return ALL supported
   media densities, not just one. T9x40 manual has nice writeup.

 - Major -> Add personality modules to library
