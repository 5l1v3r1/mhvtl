Linux utility tcopy.

tcopy source [destination]

Where source and detination should be tape drive devices.

This utility will perform a bit for bit copy from one tape to the other.
Well, actually, it would be more accurate to say a block-for-block copy.
If the source tape has multiple files - then this utility will copy all
of them, with their associated tape marks (EOFs).

If the destination operand is missing, then it is assumed that you just
want a display of the record/file information.

Notes:  

A) I stole this code off the web, there was no copyright or left on it.
I have simply reformated and commented the code. 

B) I have not yet tested this code very much (just too little time).
It appears to work.  So far I've only used DLT, 8mm and 3590 drives 
all connected via SCSI interfaces, using the linux st device driver.

So, use at your own risk.  I would appreciate some feedback though.
Especially, any difficulties/bugs.
