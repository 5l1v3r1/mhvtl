vxtape virtual tape & library system.

This package is composed of a kernel module (vtl) which is a pseudo HBA
reporting it has attached:
 1 x L700 medium changer (SMC target)
 2 x Sony SDX-900V drives (SSC targets)
 3 x Ultrium TD3 drives (SSC targets)
 3 x Super DLT600 drives (SSC targets)

The vtl is basically a stripped down scsi_debug kernel module + a char dev
'back end' to pass the SCSI commands thru to user space daemons. It is the
user space daemons responsibility to respond and process the SCSI commands.

See the INSTALL file for compile and install instructions.

This has been my first attempt at kernel level programming. Suggestions and
comments always welcome. It has also been many years since I have done any c
programming. Please be gentle..
